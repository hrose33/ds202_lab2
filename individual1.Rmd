```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://xdaiisu.github.io/ds202materials/hwlabs/choco.csv")
summary(choco)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(choco, aes(x = Rating)) + geom_histogram()
```
It does look like there are 2 outliers at the 1 and 5 area.

```{r}
rates <- choco[, "Rating"]
cocoa <- choco[, "Cocoa.Pct"]
cor(cocoa, rates, method = c("pearson"))
```
Rating and Cocoa percentage are negatively correlated with each other. This means that ratings would be higher the lower the cocoa percentage.
